<span class='text'>I was feeling like my day had just begun...</span>

<span class='text'>Where the eagle glides descending, there's an ancient river bending,</span>
<span class='text'>through the timeless gorge of changes where sleeplessness awaits...</span>
<span class='text'>I searched out my companions, who were lost in crystal canyons,</span>
<span class='text'>when the aimless blade of science slashed the pearly gates...</span>
<span class='text'>It was then that I knew I'd had enough burnt my credit card for fuel</span>
<span class='text'>Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand...</span>
<span class='text'>With a one way ticket to the land of truth, and a suitcase in my hand,</span>
<span class='text'>How I lost my friends I still don't understand...</span>

<span class='text'>They had the best selection, they were poison with protection,</span>
<span class='text'>there was nothing that they needed they had nothing left to find...</span>
<span class='text'>They were lost in rock formations, or became park bench mutations,</span>
<span class='text'>on the sidewalks and in the stations they were waiting, waiting...</span>
<span class='text'>So I got bored and left them there, they were just dead weight to me,</span>
<span class='text'>better down the road without that load...</span>
<span class='text'>Brings back the time when I was eight or nine, I was watching my mama's TV,</span>
<span class='text'>There was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode...</span>

<span class='text'>Where the vulture glides descending, there's an asphalt highway bending,</span>
<span class='text'>through libraries and museums, galaxies and stars...</span>
<span class='text'>Down the windy halls of friendship, to the rose clipped by the bullwhip,</span>
<span class='text'>the motel of lost companions waits with heated pools and bars...</span>
<span class='text'>But me, I'm not stopping there, got my own row left to hoe,</span>
<span class='text'>just another line in the field of time...</span>
<span class='text'>When those thrashers come and I'm stuck in the sun like the dinosaurs in shrines</span>
<span class='text'>But I'll know the time has come to give what's mine...</span>
